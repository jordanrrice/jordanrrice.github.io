## MTA Ridership

**Project description:** In a comprehensive project delving into mass transit usage within NYC's MTA subway system, Tableau and SQL skills are instrumental in analyzing and visualizing ridership data. SQL queries are deployed to aggregate and manipulate vast datasets encompassing station-specific ridership metrics and inter-station travel patterns. 

Leveraging Tableau, a variety of visualizations are crafted, ranging from dynamic line graphs illustrating ridership trends over time to geographical maps pinpointing station hotspots and connectivity. Additionally, interactive dashboards are developed, empowering users to explore ridership patterns, peak hours, and popular routes, thus facilitating informed decision-making for optimizing transit services and infrastructure.

### Main Insights

Comparison of ridership levels between weekdays and weekends reveals a (rather obvious) insight that weekday ridership is dramatically higher, with weekdays having 96% higher levels of passenger activity.

Evaluation of ridership distribution across the five boroughs (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island), also indicates that Manhattan & Brooklyn significantly outperform their counterparts. Staten Island comes in last unsurprisingly with its single line.

Stations found in Midtown Manhattan (Times Square 42nd, Grand Central 42nd, & Herald Square) are solidly in the top three positions. There are only two stations in the top 10 that fall outside of Midtown Manhattan at all (Fulton Street & 14th Street Union Square), and Flushing - Main Street is the only line outside of the borough of Manhattan that comes anywhere close to the highest with less than 1/3rd of the top spots passengers.

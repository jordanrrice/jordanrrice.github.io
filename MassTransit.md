## MTA Ridership

**Project description:** In a comprehensive project delving into mass transit usage within NYC's MTA subway system, Tableau and SQL skills are instrumental in analyzing and visualizing ridership data. SQL queries are deployed to aggregate and manipulate vast datasets encompassing station-specific ridership metrics and inter-station travel patterns. 

Leveraging Tableau, a variety of visualizations are crafted, ranging from dynamic line graphs illustrating ridership trends over time to geographical maps pinpointing station hotspots and connectivity. Additionally, interactive dashboards are developed, empowering users to explore ridership patterns, peak hours, and popular routes, thus facilitating informed decision-making for optimizing transit services and infrastructure.

## Deforestation across the world 

**Project description:** 
In a comprehensive project examining deforestation trends worldwide between 2000-2022, Tableau and SQL skills are leveraged to analyze and visualize data effectively. SQL queries are employed to extract and manipulate large datasets containing geographical and temporal information on forest cover. 

Utilizing Tableau, diverse visualizations are crafted, including time series charts illustrating deforestation rates over the years, geographical heatmaps pinpointing hotspots of deforestation, and comparative bar graphs showcasing the impact across different regions. Furthermore, interactive dashboards are developed, allowing users to explore the data dynamically, enhancing understanding and facilitating informed decision-making towards sustainable forest management.

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques
